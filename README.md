# GAN for MNIST

This repository contains code for a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to generate handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Repository Files

- `.gitattributes`: Configuration file for Git attributes.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `README.md`: The main documentation file explaining the repository and its contents.
- `classifier_model.h5`: Trained classification model for MNIST digits.
- `create_classification_model.py`: Script to create and train a classification model for MNIST digits.
- `create_generator_model.py`: Script to create and train the generator model of the GAN.
- `generate_img.py`: Script to generate images using the trained GAN.
- `generated_image.pickle`: Pickle file containing generated images.
- `generated_image.png`: PNG file of a sample generated image.
- `generator_model.h5`: Trained generator model of the GAN.
- `install_requirements.py`: Script to install the necessary dependencies for running the code.
- `predict_to_generated_image.py`: Script to generate images based on input predictions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/masanbasa3k/GAN_mnist.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd GAN_mnist
   ```

3. Run the `install_requirements.py` script to install the required dependencies:
   ```shell
   python install_requirements.py
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Classification Model

1. Run the `create_classification_model.py` script to create and train the classification model for MNIST digits:
   ```shell
   python create_classification_model.py
   ```

### Training the Generator Model

1. Run the `create_generator_model.py` script to create and train the generator model of the GAN:
   ```shell
   python create_generator_model.py
   ```

### Generating Images

1. Run the `generate_img.py` script to generate images using the trained GAN:
   ```shell
   python generate_img.py
   ```

### Generating Images based on Predictions

1. Run the `predict_to_generated_image.py` script to generate images based on input predictions:
   ```shell
   python predict_to_generated_image.py
   ```

## Additional Information

- The repository includes pre-trained models for both the classifier and generator, as `classifier_model.h5` and `generator_model.h5`, respectively.

- The generated images are saved as `generated_image.pickle`, which contains a Python object storing the generated images, and `generated_image.png`, which is a sample image rendered as a PNG file.

- If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please create an issue in the GitHub repository.
